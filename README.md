## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

I finally get how to build a dropdown menu using both CSS or Javascript. And the most important thing I learn with this challenge is the way we can make a fully responsive menu which I struggle a little bit before getting it right.
- Hide the menu items on mobile version
- make the menu show up in a complete different way on mobile, In a sliding way.
- I used the toggle option in Javascript


### Continued development

On next projects I wanna focus on the responsive menu again but with different kind of designs
